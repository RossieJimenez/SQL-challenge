# SQL-challenge

In this project, we began with data modeling, where we created an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) to represent the relationships between entities in the dataset. The entities included departments, dep_emp, dept_manager, employees, salaries, and titles, with relationships established through primary and foreign keys.

Moving on to data engineering, we defined table schemas for each entity, specifying data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. Tables were created in a logical order to handle foreign keys, and each CSV file was imported into its corresponding SQL table, ensuring data integrity.

For the data analysis phase, we formulated SQL queries to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. These queries addressed a variety of questions, such as listing employee information, identifying employees hired in 1986, determining department managers, associating employees with their respective departments, and retrieving frequency counts of employee last names.

In conclusion, this project demonstrated a structured approach to data modeling, engineering, and analysis using SQL. The resulting queries provided valuable information about employees, departments, and their relationships within the organization. This process lays the foundation for future data exploration and insights in a relational database context.
